# tiny-yolo-objection-detection
This repository was forked from https://github.com/nilboy/tensorflow-yolo and trained on own data.

## my contributions
 - added data augmentation in the training process
 - modified the demo.py for multi-object detection with non-maximum-suppression
 - added the evaluation code to compute the precision and recall. (for mAP evaluation, please refer to https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP )
 - trained on own data with the pretrained tiny yolo model:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yiAeTLLamRekxqVE01Yi1RRlk/view?usp=sharing
